# AppleArrowSimulation

AppleArrowSimulation is a JavaFX-based educational tool that demonstrates projectile motion by simulating an arrow's attempt to hit a moving apple. This application visualizes the concepts of gravity, initial velocity, and angles in a fun and interactive way.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of arrow physics.
- User input for initial arrow velocity and angle.
- Real-time control over the simulation (start, pause, resume, reset).
- Dynamic visualization of both arrow and apple trajectories.
- Auto-generated random horizontal velocity for the apple.
- Trial count with a maximum of 5 trials per session.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- JDK 11 or above
- JavaFX SDK 11 or above
- Maven (if building with Maven)

## Installation
